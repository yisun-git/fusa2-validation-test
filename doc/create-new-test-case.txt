Teamforge act as a private repo for acrn-unit-test, this repo will satisfy Fusa test requirment, 
so we need merge the code to ACRN-UNIT-TEST master code in our local machine and then build our obj files.

Teamforge Fusa SRS Test building step

1.setup your local building environment firstly. 

a> setup docker environment,pls refer https://wiki.ith.intel.com/display/OTCCWPQA/BKM%3A+Setup+ACRN+docker+environment
b> building hypervisor and ACRN-UNIT-TEST 
pls refer hypervisor && acrn-unit-test  building step-20190704.txt https://tf-amr-1.devtools.intel.com/ctf/code/projects.cwpqa/git/scm.FuSa_SRS_Test_Code/doc/

2.get Teamforge code 

git pull 
https://tf-amr-1.devtools.intel.com/ctf/code/projects.cwpqa/git/scm.FuSa_SRS_Test_Code/tree

(you need  apply Teamforge access right. how to download code and merge code to Teamfoge,
pls see:
https://wiki.ith.intel.com/display/OTCCWPQA/01.+Automation+code+management
https://wiki.ith.intel.com/display/OTCCWPQA/02.+Automation+code+development+process
https://wiki.ith.intel.com/display/OTCCWPQA/03.+Automation+code+review+process 
)


3.merge Temaforge code to the ACRN-UNIT-TEST master branch (https//github.com/project/acrnacrn-unit-test)

4.building your case 
this step is the same as 1.


How to add your case to building system

1.if your case run under 32bit mode only, pls add your case obj file  in x86/Makefile.i386(append your case at this line :tests = $(TEST_DIR)/xxxx.flat)

2.if your case run under 64bit mode only, pls add your case obj file in x86/Makefile.x86_64(append your case at this line :tests = $(TEST_DIR)/xxxx.flat)

3.if your case need run both 32bit mode &64bit mode ,pls add your case obj file in x86/Makefile.common (add your case to tests-common variable: tests-commone = $(TEST_DIR)/xxxx.flat

4.if your case has init&statup&unchanged test feature ,pls add make rules in x86/Makefile.init_startup
	and add obj name to unstitched-test-cases variable (unstitched-test-cases = $(TEST_DIR)/realmode.flat $(TEST_DIR)/xxxx.flat )
