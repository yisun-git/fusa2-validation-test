Prepare the development computer

  The development computer system: Ubuntu Desktop 22.04 LTS

1.	Install the necessary ACRN build tools

sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y 
mkdir -p ~/acrn-work
sudo apt install -y gcc git make vim libssl-dev libpciaccess-dev uuid-dev \
     libsystemd-dev libevent-dev libxml2-dev libxml2-utils libusb-1.0-0-dev \
     python3 python3-pip libblkid-dev e2fslibs-dev \
     pkg-config libnuma-dev libcjson-dev liblz4-tool flex bison \
     xsltproc clang-format bc libpixman-1-dev libsdl2-dev libegl-dev \
     libgles-dev libdrm-dev gnu-efi libelf-dev liburing-dev \
     build-essential git-buildpackage devscripts dpkg-dev equivs lintian \
     apt-utils pristine-tar dh-python acpica-tools python3-tqdm \
     python3-elementpath python3-lxml python3-xmlschema python3-defusedxml

2.	Get the ACRN hypervisor source code

cd ~/acrn-work
git clone https://github.com/projectacrn/acrn-hypervisor.git
cd acrn-hypervisor
git checkout release_3.3

3.	Build the Board Inspector Debian package

cd ~/acrn-work/acrn-hypervisor
debian/debian_build.sh clean && debian/debian_build.sh board_inspector

In a few seconds, the build generates a board_inspector Debian package in the parent (~/acrn-work) directory.


Prepare the Target and Generate a Board Configuration File

  The target system: Ubuntu Desktop 22.04 LTS  
  Hareware environment: connect mouse,keyboard,monitor and power supply cable,Ethernet cable or wifi.
  BIOS settings:
	Enable VMX (Virtual Machine Extensions, which provide hardware assist for CPU virtualization).
	Enable VT-d (Intel Virtualization Technology for Directed I/O, which provides additional support for managing I/O virtualization).
	Disable Secure Boot.

1.	Install Board inspector Debian package 

Use the scp command to copy the board inspector Debian package from your development computer to the /tmp directory on the target system.

scp ~/acrn-work/python3-acrn-board-inspector*.deb ubuntu@10.239.13.24:/tmp
sudo apt install -y /tmp/python3-acrn-board-inspector*.deb
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
mkdir -p ~/acrn-work

2.	Generate the board configuration file

cd ~/acrn-work
sudo acrn-board-inspector my_board
 
The Board Inspector can take a few minutes to scan your target system and create the my_board.xml file.

Use the scp command to copy my_board.xml from the target system to your development computer
scp ~/acrn-work/my_board.xml  acrn@10.239.13.22:~/acrn-work/


Build ACRN Hypervisor on the development computer

1.	Get scenario xml from repo virtualization.hypervisors.acrn.acrn-fusa-cert.validation-test/doc at fusa26262
 myrpl.hypervisor.xml

2.	Build Acrn Hypervisor
cd ~/acrn-work/acrn-hypervisor
make BOARD=~/acrn-work/my_board.xml SCENARIO=~/acrn-work/myrpl.hypervisor.xml
           
In a few minutes, the build generates a ACRN debian package in ~/acrn-work/acrn-hypervisor/build.

sudo apt install --reinstall ./build/acrn-board-*.deb
